### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy building, creating and hacking devices/tech to see how they work, or to improve them. 

I am currently working on an open source shop organization system that uses standard design philosophies and dimensions, for workbencehes, cabinets, toolchests, etc.

I prefer using opensource alternatives where possible, and as a casual freelance designer, I use FOSS applications throughout my work!

Currently I have been only been posting my designs/CAD files to GrabCAD, but I will slowly port them over to GitHub...

Some projects I'm working on include:
- Continuously upgrading my Ender 3 Pro
- Parametric shop system
- FIRST Robotics Competiton Parts Library (contact for link)
- Getting my Ham Radio License
- Buidling a budget home server/NAS
- Custom desktop CNC router

Awesome software I use daily:
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [RawTherapee](https://www.rawtherapee.com/),
- [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/), [Resolve Studio 18](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/ca/products/davinciresolve), [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/)
- [Signal](https://signal.org/), [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/)
- [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/), [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.ca/en/products/fusion-360/overview), [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/)
- SuperSlicer, moved from Cura.
- NickVision Paranolic one of the best yt-dlp frontends

I highly recomend using Inkscape 1.X as it has a TON of new features inlcuding multi-page suppport, and it's decently stable.
