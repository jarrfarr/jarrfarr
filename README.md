### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jarryd. I am co-captain on my school's FRC team, [Team 3161](team3161.ca).

I enjoy building, creating and hacking devides/tech to see how they work, or to improve them. 

I am currently working on an open source shop organization system that uses standard design philosophies and dimensions, for workbencehes, cabinets, toolchests, etc.

I prefer using opensource alternatives where possible, and as a casual freelance designer, I use FOSS applications throughout my work!

Currently I have been only been posting my designs/CAD files to GrabCAD, but I will slowly port them over to GitHub...
